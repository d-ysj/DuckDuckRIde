## Inspiration
Our inspiration for building Duck Duck Ride stemmed from the desire to create an app that allows people to travel to new places at a cheaper cost. We realized that transportation expenses can be burdensome, especially for students and people who don't have access to a car. With Duck Duck Ride, we aim to make travel more accessible, affordable, and environmentally friendly.
## What it does
Duck Duck Ride provides new ways for long-distance travel, encouraging users to share rides, meet new friends on their journeys, and reduce their carbon footprint. It is designed to benefit both drivers and passengers by saving costs and creating a more eco-friendly way to travel.
## How we built it
Our team of three divided the tasks into three sections: frontend, backend, and connecting the two. By working together in this manner, we efficiently created a seamless full-stack experience for our users.
## Challenges we ran into
We faced a few challenges during the development process, such as learning to work with React Native and determining the primary focus of our app. Ultimately, we decided to emphasize both the affordability of travel and the potential for reducing pollution through shared rides.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our ability to communicate with APIs and fetch data efficiently, as well as our new understanding of frontend development and full-stack workflow. Our teamwork and collaboration throughout the project contributed to our various accomplishments.
## What we learned
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in front-end development, working with APIs, and how full-stack applications are built and connected. Our teamwork and communication skills were integral to our success, and we will apply these lessons to future projects.
## What's next for Duck Duck Ride
We plan to enhance Duck Duck Ride by implementing a reservation system for rides on specific dates, as well as introducing a chat feature that allows drivers and riders to communicate more effectively. By continuing to develop and improve our app, we hope to make long-distance travel more accessible, affordable, and sustainable for everyone.
